`npm start` should start the app with no errors, but make sure to fix any warnings

This react app state is setup with Redux Toolkit https://redux-toolkit.js.org/usage/usage-guide

And specifically leverages RTK Query https://redux-toolkit.js.org/rtk-query/overview to fetch, create, and manage the reducer state

UI elements are chakra ui https://chakra-ui.com/docs/components/overview

The api is `https://reqres.in/` which simulates a real api (notice the delay=1 to slow down the response)

### Step 1:

In `users/services.js` there is a deleteUser endpoint that needs to be modified to be a mutation `build.mutation()`

Then in `UserList.jsx` use this new useMutation to delete a user when hitting the delete button

### Step 2:

In `UserList.jsx` there is an invalid user injected, and should throw a 404 when deleted.

Use the chakra ui toast element to show the error, https://chakra-ui.com/docs/components/feedback/toast

### Step 3: 

Clean up the ui/styling a little bit and make sure it's responsive.

#### Bonus: (only if you have the time, and this isn't taking too long)

Add a view more button on each person that opens a drawer https://chakra-ui.com/docs/components/overlay/drawer and displays all of the fields.

#### Bonus2:

Have the page number show in the url, and when you reload it fetches and displays that page on load. Same thing with the drawer/user with the user id in the url (use routes)
